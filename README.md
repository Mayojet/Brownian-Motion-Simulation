# Brownian-Motion-Simulation

Brownian motion is the random motion of a particle as a result of collisions with surrounding gaseous molecules. It is a fundamental concept in physics and has applications in various fields such as finance, biology, and physics simulations. This project focuses on simulating Brownian motion and exploring the concept of bias in the motion.


## Introduction
The project consists of two parts of the simulation:

Normal Brownian motion simulation: This part simulates the random motion of a particle in a gas without any intended bias. It generates a sequence of positions for the particle based on random collisions with surrounding molecules.

Brownian motion simulation with intended bias: This part extends the simulation to incorporate an intended bias in the particle's motion. It introduces a factor that influences the direction of the particle's movement, creating a preferred direction or pattern in the motion.

## Functions
The project provides the following functions:

`normal_brownian_motion_simulation()`: This function performs the simulation of normal Brownian motion. It generates a sequence of particle positions based on random collisions with the gas molecules.

`biased_brownian_motion_simulation()`: This function extends the simulation to incorporate a bias in the particle's motion. It takes into account the intended bias factor to influence the direction of the particle's movement.

`plot_simulation()`: This function plots the simulated Brownian motion, showing the trajectory of the particle's movement over time. It visualizes the generated sequence of positions for better understanding and analysis.
